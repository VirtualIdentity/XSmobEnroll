# IsItU
A mobile app POC with Q&amp;A to identify the user.

Q&A are based on user history on social networks (such as FB). 

Ex : 
In which recent professional event have you attended ?

- Agile Days 2016 : GOOD !
- Meetup on cooking
- WWDC 2016
- I've not attended any professional event last year

Depending on the answer, we'll build a score which will give the confidence level about your identity.
